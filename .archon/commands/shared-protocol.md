# Shared Agent Protocol

Agents operate inside a single run folder. Target source is read-only unless the human explicitly asks for code changes. Expert agents own OWASP/MITRE-aligned root-cause families. Surfaces such as API, GraphQL, upload, admin, or parser entrypoints are recon and routing signals; impacts such as RCE or account takeover are finding impacts. They are not primary expert ownership labels.

## Working Model

The durable flow is: `recon item → routing unit → scenario → result → finding candidate → triage → finding`.

- New pentest work starts with the commands and run folder, not an ad hoc LLM sweep.
- Each phase ends with a short artifact summary, the next command, and an explicit request for human approval before continuing.
- A **recon item** is a route, file, sink, auth boundary, parser, manifest, or other place worth review.
- A **routing unit** clusters recon evidence around a concrete endpoint, sink, parser, storage path, trust boundary, exposure, or dependency surface.
- A **scenario** is one routing unit paired with one expert and one proof question.
- Multiple scenarios may reference the same routing unit, recon item, or path when multiple root-cause experts are relevant. One expert per scenario is an ownership rule, not a cap on expert coverage.
- A **finding candidate** is a scenario expert's proposed reportable vulnerability.
- A **finding** is a triage-accepted vulnerability. One scenario may create many finding candidates, and triage may accept, downgrade, merge, reject, or request more context for each one.

## Phase Completion Gates

Agents should finish the approved phase by writing durable artifacts, not just a prompt or handoff file:
- Recon is ready for routing when recon inventories and routing units exist.
- Routing is ready for expert work only when the scenario backlog is recorded.
- Expert review is ready for finding triage only when scenario results and finding candidates are recorded.
- After each phase, summarize the artifacts and ask before moving on.

Do not present recon, prompt generation, a small sample of expert scenarios, or untriaged candidates as complete coverage.

Once a backlog exists, process approved scenario checkpoints until every recorded scenario is finished unless the human explicitly pauses or narrows the run. Once finding candidates exist, process approved triage checkpoints until every candidate has a recorded triage decision.

## Evidence Bar

Accepted findings require ALL of these:
1. **Reachable entrypoint or execution path**
2. **Attacker-controlled input**, including stored or second-order control
3. **Sensitive sink or security boundary**
4. **Missing, misplaced, or context-wrong guard**
5. **Concrete impact and required attacker role**

Dangerous functions, scanner hits, framework folklore, and suspicious names are hints, not proof.

## Expert Depth Standard

Expert agents should behave like family specialists. For each scenario:
1. Use the manifest's playbook to inspect obscure variants, second-order paths, runtime configuration, sibling sinks, and false-positive traps specific to that root cause.
2. A shallow "source reaches sink" answer is incomplete unless it also explains context, guard quality, exploit preconditions, actor role, and concrete impact.
3. Expert agents should widen within the same root cause before stopping. If the same vulnerable helper, policy, parser, serializer, validator, or sink is reused by nearby endpoints, jobs, tenants, file formats, or deployment aliases, record the sibling checks in `same_root_expansion` and emit distinct findings when they are independently vulnerable.

## Required Agent Workflow

1. Read the scenario, expert manifest, run config, and relevant source.
2. Map the entrypoint before judging exploitability.
3. Trace source to sink with exact paths and line numbers.
4. Check guards in the context where the sink consumes data.
5. Decide `verified`, `candidate`, `rejected`, or `needs_context`.
6. Record sibling sinks with the same root cause before stopping.
7. Queue cross-family leads instead of burying them in prose.
8. Write concise logs covering actions, evidence, decisions, status, and next handoffs. Do not log private chain-of-thought.

## Result Expectations

Scenario results should include:
- `status`: `verified`, `candidate`, `rejected`, or `needs_context`
- `expert`: the expert id
- `primary_vulnerability_class`: the root-cause family or subtype owned by the expert
- `summary`: concise decision
- `evidence`: exact source, sink, guard, and impact references (each with `path`, `line`, `snippet`, `note`)
- `surface_class_coverage`: reviewed surfaces and per-class decisions
- `same_root_expansion`: sibling source/sink checks
- `candidate_queue_entries`: structured follow-up leads
- `findings`: verified finding candidates only

Each finding candidate should include:
- `title`: standardized title in the form `<severity> - <type of vuln> - <location>`
- `severity`: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, or `informational`
- `target_path`: affected source path or component
- `attacker_role`: minimum attacker access or privilege needed
- `preconditions`: required deployment state, feature flags, data, or user steps
- `non_technical_summary`: plain-language explanation for stakeholders
- `summary`: technical root-cause summary
- `evidence`: source, sink, missing guard, line references, and proof notes
- `attack_chain`: ordered chain from entrypoint to impact
- `example_attack`: controlled-test example of what exploitation looks like
- `impact`: short impact statement for summary tooling
- `impact_analysis`: thorough blast-radius and security-boundary analysis
- `attacker_use`: how an attacker could practically use the issue
- `recommended_fix`: specific remediation guidance
- `validation_notes`: safe reproduction and fix-verification notes

The finding-triage agent owns final admission and severity due diligence. It must independently check reportability, duplicate/scope boundaries, evidence quality, confidence, and severity before a candidate is materialized under `findings/`.

## Rejection Rules

Reject or downgrade when input is:
- **Constant** (not attacker-controlled)
- **Trusted** (already validated by a verified upstream)
- **Strictly allowlisted** for the exact structural position
- **Framework-bound** in the relevant context
- **CLI/test-only** (not reachable in production)
- **Gated by privileges equivalent to the claimed impact**

Record the rejection reason so future agents do not repeat the same trace.
